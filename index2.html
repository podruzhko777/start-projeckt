       <h3>Overview</h3>
       <p>
        While the almighty 2020 Mercedes-AMG E63 S costs a lot more than most sedans, it also costs a lot less than a rocket ship. The comparison is valid because the E63 basically turns the tarmac into a launch pad every time its 603-hp twin-turbo V-8 powertrain and tenacious all-wheel-drive system are unleashed. Pair that with razor-sharp handling and a roaring soundtrack to create one of the most raucous four-doors on the planet. Of course, its elegant cabin and high-tech features live up to the brand's luxury-sedan billing. While the 2020 E63 S is more car than most people need, Mercedes-AMG ensures that investment is worth every penny.
       </p>
       <h3>Safety and Driver-Assistance Features</h3>
       <p>The E63 hasn't been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). We're also disappointed that Mercedes charges customers extra for most driver-assistance technology. Key safety features include:</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Don't call it a comeback. The BMW M5 has been here for years. However, the latest generation is rocking its peers and putting fear in the hearts of other sports sedans. Uncorking 600-plus horsepower from its twin-turbo V-8, the 2020 M5 accelerates with unbridled ferocity. Its standard all-wheel-drive system can even send all that power to the rear wheels for drivers who like to hang out the tail. Indeed, BMW has reinvented an icon that had become almost unrecognizable. While the M5 is still a big luxury sedan loaded with high-tech gadgetry, it now has a maniacal side that lately has been missing from the company's storied M division.
